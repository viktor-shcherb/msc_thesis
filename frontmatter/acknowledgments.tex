\acknowledgments{%
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof.\ Fran\c{c}ois Fleuret, for his guidance, patience, and unwavering support throughout this project. His willingness to engage in open discussions and his flexibility during the many shifts in research direction were invaluable to the completion of this work.

I am equally grateful to Prof.\ Martin Jaggi for hosting me at the Machine Learning and Optimization (MLO) laboratory at EPFL during my academic exchange. His insightful discussions and constructive feedback significantly shaped the direction of this thesis. I also wish to thank the members of the MLO lab for the productive discussions following my presentation of this work, which helped refine many of the ideas presented here.

The supportive and collaborative environment provided by both professors made navigating the challenges of this research a rewarding experience.
