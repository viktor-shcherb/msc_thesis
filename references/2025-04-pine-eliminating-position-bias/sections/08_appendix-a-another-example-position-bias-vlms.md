# APPENDIX A: ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF POSITION BIAS IN VLMs [p. 15]

**Figure 6** (p. 15): "Image of Andromeda Galaxy. GPT-4V is asked to answer the galaxy of the redbox (M110). (b), (c), (d) images are generated by flipping (a). Results show that GPT-4V can answer correctly on (c) and (d) and incorrectly on (a) and (b), revealing position bias in VLMs."

Description: Four-panel image showing the Andromeda Galaxy in different orientations with a red box marking a specific location
- Key elements: Each panel labeled (a), (b), (c), (d) shows the same galaxy image flipped in different orientations, with a red box marking the same astronomical object
- Notable patterns: The red box appears in different spatial positions across the four panels due to image flipping
- Supports claim: Demonstrates that VLMs suffer from position bias, as GPT-4V answers correctly when the object is in certain positions but incorrectly in others

To show VLMs suffer from position bias, the authors ask models to identify a small object appeared in the full image [p. 15]. They ask GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023) to identify one satellite galaxy M110 of Andromeda Galaxy (M31) [p. 15]. The central objective in Figure 6(a) is the Andromeda Galaxy and the galaxy in the red box is M110 satellite galaxy [p. 15]. Another satellite galaxy is M32 which is the brightest part near the Andromeda Galaxy [p. 15].

The authors flip the image (a) and obtain images (b), (c), and (d) [p. 15]. They prompt GPT-4V "What galaxy is in the red box?", and here are the outputs collected [p. 15]:

**(a):** "The galaxy within the red box is M32, also known as Messier 32. It's a dwarf elliptical galaxy and is a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), which is the dominant galaxy in the image. M32 is one of the more well-studied dwarf elliptical galaxies, largely due to its proximity to our own galaxy and its interactions with the Andromeda Galaxy." [p. 15]

**(b):** "The object inside the red box in the image appears to be a smaller galaxy located near the more prominent galaxy (Andromeda Galaxy, M31). This smaller galaxy is likely M32, a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy. M32 is a compact elliptical galaxy and is often visible in images as a smaller, dense, bright spot near Andromeda, as seen in the boxed area of your image." [p. 15]

**(c):** "The galaxy within the red box is M110, also known as NGC 205. M110 is a dwarf elliptical galaxy, which, like M32, is a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It is one of the members of the Local Group of galaxies, which includes the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, and about 54 other known galaxies." [p. 15]

**(d):** "The galaxy in the red box appears to be a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy, which is the prominent galaxy visible in the rest of the image. This smaller galaxy is likely M110 (NGC 205), which is a dwarf elliptical galaxy and a companion to the Andromeda Galaxy, M31. It's one of the several satellite galaxies gravitationally bound to Andromeda, visible here as a faint, elongated object in the outlined area." [p. 15]

The authors can find that models answer correctly when M110 is at the top of the image, revealing that VLMs also suffer from the position bias [p. 15]. The experiments suggest that unreliable VLMs when fine-grained image analysis are needed (e.g., small object detection (Wu & Xie, 2023)) [p. 15].
