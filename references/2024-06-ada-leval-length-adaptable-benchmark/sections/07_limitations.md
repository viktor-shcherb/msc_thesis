# Limitations [p. 9]

[p. 9] Ada-LEval is a challenging benchmark, requiring strong understanding and reasoning capabilities over long text. Due to the poor instruction following rate and copy instruction rate of open-source LLMs, Ada-LEval can hardly distinguish their long context capability through the accuracy metric.

Furthermore, as text length increases, the difficulty of Ada-LEval rises sharply under ultra-long-context settings. Even state-of-the-art proprietary models are not able to achieve an ideal performance, which further constrains its applicability to current LLMs. [p. 9]
