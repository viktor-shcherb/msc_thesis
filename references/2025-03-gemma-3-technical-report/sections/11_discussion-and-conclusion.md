# 8. Discussion and Conclusion [p. 11]

In this work, we have presented Gemma 3, the latest addition to the Gemma family of open language models for text, image, and code. In this version, we focus on adding image understanding and long context while improving multilinguality and STEM-related abilities. Our model sizes and architectures are designed to be compatible with standard hardware, and most of our architecture improvements are tailored to fit this hardware while maintaining performance.
