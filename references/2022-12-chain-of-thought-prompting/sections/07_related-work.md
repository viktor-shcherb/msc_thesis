# 7 Related Work [p. 9]

[p. 9] This work is inspired by many research areas, which are detailed in an extended related work section (Appendix C). Two directions and associated papers that are perhaps most relevant are described.

## Intermediate Steps for Reasoning [p. 9]

The first relevant direction is using intermediate steps to solve reasoning problems. Ling et al. (2017) pioneer the idea of using natural language rationales to solve math word problems through a series of intermediate steps. Their work is a remarkable contrast to the literature using formal languages to reason (Roy et al., 2015; Chiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Cobbe et al. (2021) extend Ling et al. (2017) by creating a larger dataset and using it to finetune a pretrained language model rather than training a model from scratch. In the domain of program synthesis, Nye et al. (2021) leverage language models to predict the final outputs of Python programs via first line-to-line predicting the intermediate computational results, and show that their step-by-step prediction method performs better than directly predicting the final outputs.

## Few-Shot Prompting [p. 9]

This paper also relates closely to the large body of recent work on prompting. Since the popularization of few-shot prompting as given by Brown et al. (2020), several general approaches have improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al., 2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g., instructions that are prepended to inputs), the authors' work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the outputs of language models with a chain of thought.
