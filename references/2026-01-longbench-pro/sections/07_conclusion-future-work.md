# 7 Conclusion and Future Work [p. 13]

[p. 13] The paper concludes that LongBench Pro provides a realistic and comprehensive bilingual long-context benchmark and that evaluation across 46 models exposes persistent gaps in deep long-context reasoning.

[p. 13] The authors explicitly identify a scaling tension:
- As length/complexity grow, even collaborative pipelines can face a verification-accuracy vs production-efficiency trade-off.

[p. 13] Proposed future direction:
- A recursive "Critique-of-Critique" process, described as conceptually related to meta-verification in DeepSeekMath-V2 (Shao et al., 2025), to break verification into smaller tractable sub-problems.

[p. 13] They report preliminary progress but no detailed empirical results yet in this paper.
