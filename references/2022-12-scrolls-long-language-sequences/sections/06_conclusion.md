# Conclusion [p. 8]

[p. 8] The authors propose a new benchmark that places the spotlight on naturally long texts and their intricacies. SCROLLS fills a current gap around evaluating efficient transformer architectures and their alternatives on natural language tasks, and at the same time provides a testing ground for new pretraining schemes that target long language sequences. The authors hope that SCROLLS inspires the NLP community to go beyond single sentences and paragraphs, and meet the challenges of processing and reasoning over longer discourses.
