# Appendix G. Prompting Details [p. 25]

[p. 25] In order to enable the base model to output answers in a step-by-step format to which a PRM can be applied, the authors use a 4-shot prompt consisting of randomly selected correct answer examples from the PRM800k data released by Lightman et al. [22]. Specifically they use answers from the phase 1 training split. These answers correspond to GPT-4 generated correct answer examples, which include the correct step-by-step format. In initial experiments, they found that this prompting procedure produces similar results to the prompt used in Lewkowycz et al. [20]. They use this prompt for generating training data for the PRM and the revision model. They also use this prompt when conducting search against the PRM on the test-set. To grade the final answer predicted by this prompt, they use the grading function released by Lightman et al. [22].
