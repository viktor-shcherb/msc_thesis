# C Sample Generations [p. 12-14]

[p. 12] The purpose of this section is to verify that models trained on ablated contexts can still generate text that is comparable to text generated by a model trained with full contextual information. The authors select a prompt from a randomly chosen Wikipedia article in the WikiText-103 validation set; each model generates a sentence (after finishing the sentence in progress) given the appropriately ablated version of the prompt. The prompt consists of 768 tokens, the last 256 of which remain unchanged for all versions of the prompt, so that the ablations are in the long range relative to the point of generation.

## Prompt

[p. 12-13] The prompt text (drawn from a Wikipedia article about Daniel Radcliffe) ends with:

> at two independent schools for boys: Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" rather than jealousy.
>
> As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work "really difficult." He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. "The paparazzi, they'd love it," he told Details magazine in 2007. "If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were."

> In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J.K. Rowling. [p. 13]

The prompt continues with a detailed account of casting, filming, and the release of the first Harry Potter film through the second installment (Chamber of Secrets).

## Generations by ablation condition

[p. 13-14] Each generation begins mid-sentence (continuing from the prompt). The ablation conditions and their sample generations are:

**full information:**
> sing Potter film in the series at the time of its release. After appearing in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Radcliffe tried to avoid trying to improve his role.

**shuffle all:**
> sing Potter film in the series (behind Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), the highest grossing Harry Potter film in the series. The following year, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the top-grossing Potter film, making it the highest grossing Harry Potter film in the series.

**shuf. within sent.:**
> sing Potter film in the series (until 2009's Gold Glove), selling 1.5 million tickets in its first week. The title of the film's sequel was also a major factor in the success of Philosopher, while its underperformance dropped because of series 3's Sci-Fi Channel.

**shuf. within trigrams:**
> sing Potter film at the time of its release. The film had a financial success worldwide and received five Academy Award nominations at the 56th Academy Awards.

**shuf. trigrams within sent.:**
> sing Potter film in the series at the United States box office. His appearance in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone did not make it to the United States until 2006.

**shuf. trigrams globally:**
> sing Potter film at the time and was the third highest grossing film of 2006, the highest-grossing film in the series. In 2006, Radcliffe acted in his first major role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part I, where he played Harry's Chief Engineer, Harry Potter's primary antagonist.

**sent. shuf.:**
> sing Potter film in the series at the time of its release. At the end of 2009, new backers were looking for a leading role in the film, with Radcliffe starting the role of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

**cont. words:**
> sing Harry Potter film of all time after Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the highest-grossing film of the 2007-2008 financial year. The film's success meant that he and his wife bought a four-bedroom apartment in the 1960s, "ready to keep them warm", adding "They could never make another effort to make something exciting for people who were usually very aware of the housing shortage but hadn't been very conscious of that".

**N & VB & ADJ:**
> sing animated film in the series after The Lion King. A similar amount of praise came in 2008 when The Magic King was released.

**N & VB:**
> sing animated film in the series. A significant amount of critical reviews were given by publications in The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, and The Washington Post. The film was released in theaters in 2008.

**N:**
> sing animated film in the series.

**named entities:**
> sing animated film in the series.

> = = Appearances extended Persons (1990 -- 2014) = =

**rare:**
> sing animated film in the series.

> = = = Part two = = =

**common:**
> sing animated film in the series. A review in The New York Times found that Hans was not as strong as Watson but as well as Mr. Trough and Mr. Trough.

[p. 14] The sample generations illustrate that models trained with full information and less destructive ablations (shuffle all, shuf. within sent., shuf. within trigrams, shuf. trigrams within sent., shuf. trigrams globally, sent. shuf., cont. words) produce coherent text that remains on topic (Harry Potter films). More aggressive lexical ablations (N & VB & ADJ, N & VB, N, named entities, rare, common) shift the generated content away from the specific topic, producing text about generic "animated films" rather than Harry Potter, though the text remains grammatically coherent. The most aggressive lexical ablations (N, named entities, rare) produce very short generations before introducing Wikipedia-style section headings unrelated to the original topic.
