## Content

The page presents the research under the **Interpretability Research** category, listing:

- **Title:** A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits
- **Date:** December 22, 2021
- **Call-to-action:** "Read Paper" button linking to https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html

## Framing Within Anthropic's Research Agenda

The research is categorized under "Interpretability Research," positioning it within Anthropic's broader commitment to developing mathematical foundations for understanding how neural networks function internally. This work represents a core component of the company's AI safety and reliability efforts -- the premise being that understanding transformer internals at a mechanistic level is necessary for ensuring safe and reliable AI systems.

The Transformer Circuits Thread (transformer-circuits.pub) serves as Anthropic's dedicated publication venue for mechanistic interpretability research, separate from traditional academic publication channels. This article was the foundational publication in that thread.

## Related Research Listed on Page

The page includes links to other Anthropic research publications, though the specific related papers shown on the page at the time of fetching were not directly related to the transformer circuits research thread. The Transformer Circuits Thread itself contains a series of follow-up publications building on this framework, including:

- "In-context Learning and Induction Heads" (2022) -- extending the induction head analysis to larger models
- "Toy Models of Superposition" (2022) -- investigating the superposition phenomenon discussed in the framework paper
- "Softmax Linear Units" -- exploring alternatives to standard activation functions in the context of interpretability

[not accessible: The full list of related research on the Anthropic page changes over time and the page content at time of fetch was minimal.]

## Additional Context

The Anthropic research page does not contain substantive technical content beyond what is in the main article. Its primary function is discoverability -- making the research findable through Anthropic's research index alongside their other publications. All technical content resides in the main article at transformer-circuits.pub.
