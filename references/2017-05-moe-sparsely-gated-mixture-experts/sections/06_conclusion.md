# 6 Conclusion [p. 9]

[p. 9] This work is the first to demonstrate major wins from conditional computation in deep networks. The authors carefully identified the design considerations and challenges of conditional computing and addressed them with a combination of algorithmic and engineering solutions. While they focused on text, conditional computation may help in other domains as well, provided sufficiently large training sets. They look forward to seeing many novel implementations and applications of conditional computation in the years to come.
