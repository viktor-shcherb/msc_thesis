**Priority:** primary

## Core positioning

The repository README frames the project as a practical software layer for mechanistic interpretability on GPT-style models:

> "TransformerLens is a practical, extensively documented library for mechanistic interpretability of GPT-style language models."

> "It aims to provide a clean, easy-to-use, well-tested and documented library for accessing and editing internals of models."

## Declared workflow capabilities

The README explicitly enumerates contribution areas and capabilities:

- Loading models from Hugging Face and loading datasets to run them on.
- Accessing model activations and supporting read/write interventions.
- Enabling residual-stream interventions, including activation patching workflows.
- Decomposing attention-head outputs into component contributions.
- Supporting interpretation-focused clean training runs.

## Ecosystem context

The README positions the project as part of an expanding interpretability tooling ecosystem, and links additional packages and notebooks built around or alongside TransformerLens.
