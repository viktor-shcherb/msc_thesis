# E Suffix Identification [p. 14-16]

[p. 14] In the main text, the suffix identification results are presented with 128-token long suffix. Here, results are provided when evaluating the accuracy with suffix of different length. Interestingly, the accuracy of distinguishing a gold suffix first increases with the suffix length, reaching the best when the suffix length is around 10 to 20, then decreases as the suffix becomes longer. This is likely because the sequence becomes more probable as incorporating more local context (part of the suffix). [p. 14]

In Table 3 and Table 4, a complete example of the suffix identification task is presented. The prefix contains 1024 tokens, and each of the suffixes contains 128 tokens. Lower perplexity of obviously wrong suffix (e.g. negative 1,3,4) indicates the current RT model is not properly taking advantage of distant context to make sequence-level predictions. [p. 14]

**Figure 21** (p. 15): "Suffix identification accuracy when evaluated with different prefix length."
- Single panel.
- X-axis: prefix length (0-8000); Y-axis: accuracy (~0.28-0.60).
- Six lines for different suffix lengths: suffix-len-5, suffix-len-10, suffix-len-20, suffix-len-40, suffix-len-80, suffix-len-128.
- suffix-len-10 and suffix-len-20 achieve the highest accuracy (~0.55-0.58), peaking around prefix length ~2000 and then plateauing.
- suffix-len-5 achieves slightly lower accuracy (~0.48-0.50).
- suffix-len-40 is lower (~0.45).
- suffix-len-80 is around ~0.40-0.42.
- suffix-len-128 is the lowest (~0.38-0.40).
- All lines plateau after prefix length ~2K, confirming that additional context beyond 2K does not help suffix identification regardless of suffix length.

**Table 3** (p. 15-16): "Suffix identification example, extracted from the book *Beyond the City* by Arthur Conan Doyle. For each suffix, we show the perplexity of the suffix evaluated with the Routing Transformer. RT assigns a lot lower perplexity to examples (e.g. negative 1,3,4) that are obviously wrong given the prefix."

| Prefix | Not a bit, sir.Out with it!I have faced death too often to flinch from it now, though I saw it as near me as you are ... "How far is it to his place?""Oh, a mile at least.We can have a cab.""A mile? |
| Gold suffix (ppl=74.4) | Then we shall see if there is any truth in what that swab of a doctor said.Come, my boy, and clap on all sail, and see who can stay the longest."Then the sober denizens of the heart of business London saw a singular sight as they returned from their luncheons.Down the roadway, dodging among cabs and carts, ran a weather-stained elderly man, with wide flapping black hat, and homely suit of tweeds.With elbows braced back, hands clenched near his armpits, and chest protruded, he scudded along, while close at his heels lumbered a large-limbed, heavy, yellow mustached young man, who seemed to feel the exercise a good deal more than his senior.On they dashed, helter-skelter, until they pulled up panting at the office where the lawyer of the |
| Negative 1 (ppl=34.6) | If I can see Mr.Elberry to-day we may let you have a cheque to-morrow.Try another pinch.No?Well, good-bye.I am very happy to have been of service."Mr.McAdam bowed them out, for he was a very busy man, and they found themselves in the street once more with lighter hearts than when they had left it."Well, Westmacott, I am sure I am very much obliged to you," said the Admiral."You have stood by me when I was the better for a little help, for I'm clean out of my soundings among these city sharks.But I've something to do now which is more in my own line, and I need not trouble you any more.""Oh, it is no trouble.I have nothing |
| Negative 2 (ppl=71.69) | It was not until he had signed and sent it off that the full significance of all that he had done broke upon him.He had sacrificed everything.His pension was gone.He had nothing save only what he could earn.But the stout old heart never quailed.He waited eagerly for a letter from the Saint Lawrence Shipping Company, and in the meanwhile he gave his landlord a quarter's notice.Hundred pound a year houses would in future be a luxury which he could not aspire to.A small lodging in some inexpensive part of London must be the substitute for his breezy Norwood villa.So be it, then!Better that a thousand fold than that his name should be associated with failure and disgrace.On that morning Harold Denver was to meet the creditors of the firm, and to explain the situation to them.It was a hateful task |
| Negative 3 (ppl=33.54) | He hurried in, fearing that she might have taken some turn for the worse, but he was reassured to find her sitting up in her bed, with Clara and Ida Walker in attendance upon her.She had removed the handkerchief, and had put on a little cap with pink ribbons, and a maroon dressing-jacket, daintily fulled at the neck and sleeves."My dear friend." said she as he entered, "I wish to make a last few remarks to you.No, no," she continued, laughing, as she saw a look of dismay upon his face."I shall not dream of dying for at least another thirty years.A woman should be ashamed to die before she is seventy.I wish, Clara, that you would ask your father to step up.And you, Ida, just pass me my cigarettes, and |
| Negative 4 (ppl=34.92) | look!!!"Her voice had fallen suddenly to a quivering whisper and she was pointing to the Westmacotts' house.Her sister gave a gasp of horror, and stood with a clutch at Monica's arm, staring in the same direction.There was a light in the front room, a slight, wavering light such as would be given by a small candle or taper.The blind was down, but the light shone dimly through.Outside in the garden, with his figure outlined against the luminous square, there stood a man, his back to the road, his two hands upon the window ledge, and his body rather bent as though he were trying to peep in past the blind.So absolutely still and motionless was he that in spite of the moon they might well have overlooked him were it not for that tell-tale light behind. |
| Negative 5 (ppl=47.66) | Again the Admiral burst out cheering."There remains, therefore, about L3,200 which has to be found within ten days.No man shall lose by me.I gave them my word in the room that if I worked my soul out of my body every one of them should be paid.I shall not spend a penny upon myself until it is done.But some of them can't wait.They are poor men themselves, and must have their money.They have issued a warrant for Pearson's arrest.But they think that he has got away to the States.""These men shall have their money," said the Admiral."Dad!""Yes, my boy, you don't know the resources of the family.One never does know until one tries.What have you yourself now?""I have about a |

Note: Table 4 is presented as a continuation of the same example format. The table content on page 16 shows the negative suffixes (1-5) with their perplexities, which are reproduced in Table 3 above. Tables 3 and 4 together form the complete suffix identification example; Table 3 contains the prefix and gold suffix, and Table 4 contains the negative suffixes with their perplexities.
