# C Token overlaps [p. 13]

[p. 13] The authors have shown in Section 3 that infrequent tokens, tokens inside subword clusters, and tokens that can only be copied from distant context benefit from context longer than 2K tokens. It is possible that these improvements come from the same set of tokens shared across these three types of tokens. To verify if there are significant overlaps among those three types of tokens, the overlapped ratio is computed in Table 2. Except for in-subword and infrequent tokens, the overlapped ratios are all below 0.1. [p. 13]
