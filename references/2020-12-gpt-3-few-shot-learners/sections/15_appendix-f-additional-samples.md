# F. Additional Samples from GPT-3 [p. 48–49]

[p. 48] GPT-3 adapts well to many tasks other than the ones explored in the main body of the paper. As an example, in Figure F.1, four uncurated samples are shown from a prompt suggesting that the model write a poem, with a given title, in the style of Wallace Stevens. The authors first experimented with a few prompts, then generated four samples with no additional editing or selection (sampling at temperature 1 using nucleus sampling [HBFC19] with $P = 0.9$). Completions were truncated when the model began to write a new title and author heading, or broke into prose commentary.

## Figure F.1

**Figure F.1** (p. 49): "Four uncurated completions from a context suggesting the model compose a poem in the style of Wallace Stevens with the title 'Shadows on the Way'."

The figure shows:
- **Context prompt:** Three poems are provided as context: "The City" by C. P. Cavafy (translated by Edmund Keeley), "Some Trees" by John Ashbery, and then the title "Shadows on the Way" attributed to Wallace Stevens. The actual poem texts for the first two are omitted in the display (marked "[Poem text omitted]"), providing only titles and authors as stylistic context.
- **Generated Poem 1:** Begins "I must have shadows on the way / If I am to walk I must have / Each step taken slowly and alone / To have it ready made" and continues for several stanzas touching on themes of grey, green, purple, sun, snow, and ends with imagery of a man walking into a wood, hearing voices, seeing shadows.
- **Generated Poem 2:** Begins "There is a way in the world. / That way a man may live in a small town" and continues through themes of small-town life, the passage of time, a young man walking to the Spring, and ends "Comes to the wood."
- **Generated Poem 3:** Begins "The sun was all we had. Now, in the shade / All is changed. The mind must dwell on those / White fields, that to its eyes were always old" and continues with imagery of ancient gleams, dark tones, stairways of the dead, light, forest glades, island gardens, and ends "And of the unspoken name a friend."
- **Generated Poem 4:** Begins "Nobody will come to this place. It is a road that leads nowhere. / The solitude is deep. The mountains are high." and continues with imagery of desolation, wind, birds, silence, forest, darkness, and ends "Here, under this sky empty and full of light."

All four poems demonstrate stylistic coherence with modernist/post-modernist poetry conventions, using imagery, enjambment, and contemplative tone consistent with the prompt's request for Wallace Stevens-style verse.
