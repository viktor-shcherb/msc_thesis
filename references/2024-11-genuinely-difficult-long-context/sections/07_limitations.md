# Limitations [p. 6]

## Formality

In the context of this work, we have deliberately adhered to a taxonomy based on an intuitive description, in the interest of utility to a wide diversity of research and flexibility for future work. Difficulty in searching for and extracting information, and quantity of information, are both vague terms that can only be grounded in the context of a specific family of tasks and use-cases. We intend for this work to serve as a call to action and a nod for a shared vocabulary in the interest of more informed long-context task design in the future, rather than to anchor the taxonomy to a specific and fragile point in time.
