# 6 Conclusion [p. 10]

We introduced LongGenBench, a synthetic benchmark that evaluates long-form generation capabilities of language models by testing their ability to adhere to instructions over extended sequences. In evaluating nine advanced models with context sizes ranging from 32K to 128K tokens, we observed significant performance degradation compared to benchmarks like "Ruler", with common failure modes including premature task termination, incomplete responses, disregard for instructions, and repetitive content generation. These results highlight key challenges for current models in handling long-form tasks and underscore the need for advancements in model architecture and training data to improve coherence, instruction adherence, and content diversity over extended outputs [p. 10].
