# Appendix G: Greater-Than task details and qualitative evidence [p. 26-27]

[p. 26] Uses 100 random datapoints from the Greater-Than dataset from prior mechanistic interpretability work.

Reported reference numbers:
- Ground-truth style circuit KL divergence to full model: 0.078.
- Ground-truth style probability-difference score: 72% vs full-model 84% on their evaluation subset.

[p. 26-27] ACDC recovers circuits containing the expected early-layer, mid-layer, and late-layer components; one reported run uses threshold `τ = 0.01585` when optimizing the Greater-Than metric.
