# Appendix M: Automated circuit discovery and OR gates [p. 34]

[p. 34] Introduces a toy OR-gate case showing a failure mode: current methods may not reliably recover both causal inputs to nonlinear gate-like structures.

Reported outcome on the toy case:
- ACDC recovers one OR input but can miss the second depending on pruning order.
- HISP/SP also show limitations in this setup.

The appendix uses this as a targeted stress test, not a language-model benchmark.
