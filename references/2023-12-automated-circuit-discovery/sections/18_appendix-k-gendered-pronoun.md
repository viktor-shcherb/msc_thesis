# Appendix K: Gendered pronoun completion (qualitative) [p. 32-33]

[p. 32-33] Presents an example use of ACDC in a novel research project (gendered pronoun completion in GPT-2 Small).

Reported qualitative finding:
- Recovered pathways highlighted a non-obvious route through specific token positions and MLP-heavy interactions, helping formulate follow-up mechanistic hypotheses for targeted testing.

The appendix uses this as evidence that ACDC can support exploratory hypothesis generation, not just benchmark recovery.
