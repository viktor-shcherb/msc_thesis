# Appendix N: Connection to Causal Scrubbing [p. 35]

[p. 35] Positions ACDC and Causal Scrubbing as complementary:
- **ACDC:** broad search over candidate subgraphs/hypotheses.
- **Causal Scrubbing:** deeper, more expensive testing of specific mechanistic hypotheses.

The appendix explains that ACDC effectively uses a restricted family of scrubbing-style interventions to keep search computationally tractable.
