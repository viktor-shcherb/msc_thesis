# Appendix B: Impact statement [p. 16]

[p. 16] The authors argue that automating circuit discovery could improve transparency and safety by making model internals more analyzable.

Potential benefits listed:
- Better understanding of model behaviors and errors.
- Better control over out-of-distribution behavior.
- Foundation for architecture improvements informed by interpretability.

Risks listed:
- Interpretability tooling can potentially be used by bad actors to steer models toward harmful behavior.
- The method is not yet mature enough for high-stakes settings requiring exact behavior guarantees.
