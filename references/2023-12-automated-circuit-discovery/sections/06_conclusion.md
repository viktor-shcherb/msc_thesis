# 6 Conclusion [p. 9]

[p. 9] The paper concludes that a large part of mechanistic circuit extraction can be automated and presents ACDC as a practical method for that step.

Main takeaway claims:
- ACDC and adapted SP recover substantial portions of known language-model circuits.
- Zero-patching ACDC can perfectly recover tracr toy-model circuits in their evaluation setup.
- ACDC has already shown qualitative utility in follow-up work (gendered pronoun completion case study).

Limitations emphasized in conclusion:
- Current methods can miss negative components.
- Results are sensitive to metric/hyperparameter choices and are not uniformly robust.

[p. 9] The authors argue automation is likely necessary for scaling interpretability to larger contemporary models and release open-source code for ACDC.
