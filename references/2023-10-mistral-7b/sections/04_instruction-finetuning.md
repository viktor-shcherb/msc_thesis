# 4 Instruction Finetuning [p. 4-5]

[p. 4] To evaluate the generalization capabilities of Mistral 7B, it was fine-tuned on instruction datasets publicly available on the Hugging Face repository. No proprietary data or training tricks were utilized. Mistral 7B -- Instruct model is described as a simple and preliminary demonstration that the base model can easily be fine-tuned to achieve good performance. [p. 4]

## Chat Model Comparison

**Table 3: Comparison of Chat models.** Mistral 7B -- Instruct outperforms all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B -- Chat models. [p. 4]

| Model | Chatbot Arena ELO Rating | MT Bench |
|---|---|---|
| WizardLM 13B v1.2 | 1047 | 7.2 |
| **Mistral 7B Instruct** | **1031** | **6.84 +/- 0.07** |
| Llama 2 13B Chat | 1012 | 6.65 |
| Vicuna 13B | 1041 | 6.57 |
| Llama 2 7B Chat | 985 | 6.27 |
| Vicuna 7B | 997 | 6.17 |
| Alpaca 13B | 914 | 4.53 |

Mistral 7B -- Instruct exhibits superior performance compared to all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B -- Chat models. [p. 4]

## Human Evaluation

[p. 4] An independent human evaluation was conducted on https://llmboxing.com/leaderboard. Participants were provided with a set of questions along with anonymous responses from two models and were asked to select their preferred response. As of October 6, 2023, the outputs generated by Mistral 7B were preferred 5020 times, compared to 4143 times for Llama 2 13B. [p. 4]

**Figure 6** (p. 7): "Human evaluation of Mistral 7B -- Instruct vs Llama 2 13B -- Chat Example. An example of human evaluation from llmboxing.com. The question asks for recommendations of books in quantum physics. Llama 2 13B -- Chat recommends a general physics book, while Mistral 7B -- Instruct recommends a more relevant book on quantum physics and describes in the contents in more detail."

The figure shows a side-by-side comparison of responses from mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1 (Round Winner) and llama-2-13b-chat to the question "Can you recommend a foundational and accessible book about quantum physics?" with a health bar showing Mistral 7b with 5 Health Remaining and Llama 2 13b with 1 Health Remaining.
