# 3 Approaches [p. 3]

For the existing approaches for long context, we summarize their characteristics and propose a novel taxonomy different from previous work. As illustrated in Figure 1, mainstream methods are divided into four major categories:
1. Positional encoding
2. Context compression
3. Retrieval augmented
4. Attention pattern [p. 3]

These are introduced below. For more details, please see the Appendix A [p. 3].
