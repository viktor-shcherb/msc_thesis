# 6 Conclusion [p. 8]

In this survey, we first list three inherent challenges in processing long context. And then we propose a novel taxonomy for long context approaches and summarize the similarities and differences in each category. In addition, we systematically review the work on evaluation, summarize the data, tasks, and metrics related to long context based on existing benchmark. Finally, we list unsolved issues and put forward our insights on the future development of long context domain [p. 8].
