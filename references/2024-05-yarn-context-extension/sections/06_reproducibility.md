# 6 Reproducibility [p. 11]

To aid in reproducibility, as supplementary material, the authors provide the entirety of the code used to train the YaRN models in Table 2, as well as the evaluation code that produced Figure 1 and Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The code also contains implementations of various extension methods referenced throughout the paper. For training YaRN, they used the publicly available PG19 dataset [29] tokenized to 64k tokens.
