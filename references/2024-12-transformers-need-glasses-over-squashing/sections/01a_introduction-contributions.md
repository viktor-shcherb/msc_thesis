# 1 Introduction (continued) [p. 3]

- Impact of floating point precision: the authors explore how low floating-point precision exacerbate the identified theoretical issues, causing them to manifest even in relatively short input sequences.

- Empirical validation of theoretical analysis: the theoretical findings are supported by real-world experiments conducted on contemporary LLMs, demonstrating practical implications of the limitations identified.
