## Large Language Models [p. 35–36]

[p. 35–36] The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs. Following the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B parameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized models, e.g. Galactica, for science (Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in this progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference (Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-source models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.

[p. 36] Yet, when it comes to the "production-ready" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there is a marked distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with human preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the open-source community.

[p. 36] Attempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set by their closed-source counterparts.

## Instruction Tuning [p. 36]

[p. 36] Wei et al. (2021) obtained zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by fine-tuning LLMs on numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction tuning as a function of number of tasks, model size, prompt settings, etc. Prompts used for instruction tuning can be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used to refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in which models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase the likelihood that their final answer is correct.

[p. 36] RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al. (2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications. In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models' responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.

[p. 36] Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled fine-tuning data with the model's own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as "RL from AI Feedback" (RLAIF).

## Known LLM Safety Challenges [p. 36]

[p. 36] Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards like bias, toxicity, private data leakage, and the potential for malicious uses. Solaiman et al. (2023) categorizes these impacts into two groups -- those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a societal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm. Work from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented LLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes a taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between potential positive and negative impacts from releasing dialogue models.

[p. 36] Investigations into red teaming reveal specific challenges in tuned LLMs, with studies by Ganguli et al. (2022) and Zhuo et al. (2023) showcasing a variety of successful attack types and their effects on the generation of harmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as (Mialon et al., 2023), have also raised red flags around advanced emergent model behaviors, cyber threats, and potential misuse in areas like biological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an over-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). The authors are committed to continuing work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues.
