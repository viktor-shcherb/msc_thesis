# 7 Conclusion [p. 36]

[p. 36] In this study, Llama 2 is introduced, a new family of pretrained and fine-tuned models with scales of 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing open-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation sets examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4. The paper meticulously elaborated on the methods and techniques applied in achieving the models, with a heavy emphasis on their alignment with the principles of helpfulness and safety. To contribute more significantly to society and foster the pace of research, access to Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat has been responsibly opened. As part of the ongoing commitment to transparency and safety, the authors plan to make further improvements to Llama 2-Chat in future work.
