## QA1 single-supporting-fact [p. 27]

**Facts:** Sandra moved to the kitchen. Sandra went back to the garden. Sandra journeyed to the office. Mary moved to the office. Sandra journeyed to the bathroom. Daniel moved to the office. Daniel went back to the kitchen. Mary went to the hallway.

**Input:** Now this loss of the sense of proportion in human affairs, Sir, is a very bad sign, and a well-nigh infallible indicator of nerve-strain and service-strain and overpressure. **Sandra went back to the kitchen.** But I find yet more unmistakable evidence in support of my contention in the extraordinary emotional sensibility revealed by these headlines whenever some unfortunate person has been sentenced to death for the most commonplace of crimes. There is clearly a profound conviction that the jury who heard the evidence, the judge who pronounced their verdict of guilty, the only possible conclusion they could reasonable come to, and **the SECRETARY OF STATE** who found himself unable to recommend a reprieve, were, one and all, engaged in a cold-blooded conspiracy against a perfectly innocent man. The convict has said himself, and that seems to be considered sufficient. And so, night after night, the authors of these headlines harrow themselves by announcing such items as "Blank protests his innocence on the Scaffold." "Doomed Scene on the Scaffold." **Sandra went back to the garden.** Consider the strain of all these altercations of hope and despair, repeated time after time, and almost invariably bound up with some piteous tale or other of suffering or deferring the fate of their protege by a single hour! **Sandra journeyed to the office.** Is it not too much for the strongest constitution to endure? a service from which the sense of humour and from all of its members? Yes, Sir, whether these devoted servants of the public know it or not, they are running a most frightful risk; the word which hangs above their heads may fall at any moment. **Mary moved to the office. Sandra journeyed to the bathroom. Daniel moved to the office. Daniel went back to the kitchen. Mary went to the hallway.** Have they left themselves any epithet in reserve capable of expressing their sensations at all adequately? They have not; they have so squandered participles and adjectives in such reckless profusion that they will discover they are reduced to the condition of inarticulate bankrupts; and, speaking as a medical man, ...

**Question:** Where is Mary? **Answer:** hallway

## QA2 two-supporting-facts [p. 28]

**Facts:** John journeyed to the garden. John grabbed the apple there. Mary travelled to the hallway. Mary went back to the bathroom. Mary went to the garden. Mary travelled to the office. Daniel went to the office. Daniel went to the bedroom. Sandra went back to the office. Sandra journeyed to the garden. Mary travelled to the kitchen. Daniel moved to the kitchen. John put down the apple. Daniel journeyed to the garden. Sandra went to the hallway. John got the apple there. Daniel travelled to the bedroom. Sandra moved to the hallway. John discarded the apple. Mary travelled to the garden.

**Context:** "From what I have already observed," said Mr. **John journeyed to the garden. John grabbed the apple there. Mary travelled to the hallway. Mary went back to the bathroom.** Ellison, "you will understand that I reject all opinions, here expressed, of 'recalling the original beauty of the country.' The original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is said in respect to the 'detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color,' is a mere vagueness of speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which guides in no degree. **Mary went to the garden.** The original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is said in respect to the 'detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color,' is a mere vagueness of speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which guides in no degree. **Mary travelled to the office. Daniel went to the office. Daniel went to the bedroom.** That the true 'result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles,' is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. **Sandra went back to the office.** The merit suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that merit which consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule, the loftier merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be apprehended solely in its results. **Daniel moved to the kitchen. John put down the apple. Daniel journeyed to the garden.** Rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance--to the virtues which deny or refrain. Beyond this, the critical art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build an Odyssey, but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a 'Tempest,' an 'Inferno,' a 'Prometheus Bound,' a 'Nightingale,' such as that of Keats, or the 'Sensitive Plant' of Shelley. **Sandra went to the hallway. John discarded the apple.** But, the thing ...** Mary travelled to the garden.**

**Question:** Where is the apple? **Answer:** garden

## QA3 three-supporting-facts [p. 29]

**Facts:** Sandra travelled to the office. Sandra picked up the football there. Sandra journeyed to the garden. Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.

But, the thing done, the wonder accomplished, and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. **Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.** The sophists of the negative school who, through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime." ...

**Question:** Where was the football before the bathroom? **Answer:** garden

## QA4 two-arg-relations [p. 29]

**Facts:** The garden is south of the bathroom. The bedroom is north of the bathroom.

**Context:** "A mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty." This is just; and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so. I repeat that the principle here expressed, is incontrovertible; but there may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested--an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would bestow on the landscape garden an immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow. **The garden is south of the bathroom.** The true poet possessed of very unusual pecuniary resources, might, possibly, while retaining the necessary idea of art or interest or culture, so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of Beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of Art. **The bedroom is north of the bathroom.** In the most rugged of the scenes of pure Nature--there is apparent the art of a Creator, yet is this art apparent only to reflection; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. Now, let us suppose this sense of the Almighty Design to be harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and magnificence--the sense of the sublime--the sense that in it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God--or the Art of the intermediary or secondary Nature--a Nature which is not God, nor an emanation of God, but which still is Nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God--If it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this--in the free exercise in the open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans--in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford--in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect ...

**Question:** What is south of the bathroom? **Answer:** garden

## QA5 three-arg-relations [p. 30]

**Facts:** Fred grabbed the football there. Jeff took the apple there. Jeff dropped the apple. Bill picked up the apple there. Mary travelled to the kitchen. Mary went back to the hallway. Bill went to the garden. Fred travelled to the hallway. Bill passed the apple to Fred. Fred left the apple. Fred went back to the hallway. Fred handed the football to Mary.

**Context:** It was evident that the besiegers were in no hurry; that they were living upon the provisions left in the valley; and that it was their intention to reduce the besieged by famine. **Fred grabbed the football there. Jeff took the apple there.** In fact the inhabitants of the Val d'Avon had been able to carry with them only a few days of provisions. **Jeff dropped the apple.** We have described the three kinds of porcelain made in Hizen for exportation to Europe, and we have seen that by the middle of the seventeenth century this commerce, in the hands of the Dutch, and to some extent of the Chinese, had already attained large proportions. Before turning to the kilns that sprung up in other parts of Japan during the eighteenth century--for these the origin in every case can be traced back directly or indirectly to the early Hizen factories--we must say a word about some other varieties of porcelain made at Arita of a neighbourhood, that is destined for foreign use. **Bill picked up the apple there.** The village or town of Arita, of which the better-known Imari is the port, lies about fifty miles to the north-east of Nagasaki, and it may almost be regarded as the King-dê-chen of Japan. **Mary travelled to the kitchen. Mary went back to the hallway.** The clay and china-stone used there is now brought, for the most part, from the adjacent islands, from Hirado, from Amakusa, and even from the more remote Goto islands. **Bill went to the garden.** By a combination of some of the most important potters of the district, and with the assistance of some wealthy merchants, a company of the Korean was formed twenty-five years ago,[123] and an attempt was made to keep up the quality of the porcelain produced, at least from a technical point of view. **Fred travelled to the hallway. Bill passed the apple to Fred. Fred left the apple.** MIKOCHI OR HIRADO WARE.--It was with a somewhat similar object that, ... **Fred went back to the hallway. Fred handed the football to Mary.**

**Question:** What did Bill give to Fred? **Answer:** apple
