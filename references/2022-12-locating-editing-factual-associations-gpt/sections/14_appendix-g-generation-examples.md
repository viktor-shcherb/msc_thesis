# Appendix G: Generation Examples [p. 27-29]

[p. 27-29] Qualitative examples are shown for GPT-2 XL and GPT-J across multiple inserted counterfactuals.

Main qualitative observations recorded by authors:

- ROME often preserves subject essence while changing relation-specific content.
- FT frequently causes repetition/degeneration in fluency.
- FT+L may under-generalize or show essence drift.
- MEND/KE behavior varies by case; can under-edit or drift.
