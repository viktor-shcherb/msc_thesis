## Probing and Causal Analysis

- Probing classifiers for linguistic properties: Ettinger et al. (2016), Adi et al. (2017), Hupkes et al. (2018), Conneau et al. (2018), Belinkov et al. (2017), Belinkov and Glass (2019).
- Causal-mediation/interventional analysis in NLP models: Vig et al. (2020a,b), Finlayson et al. (2021), Feder et al. (2021), Elazar et al. (2021b).

[p. 9] This paper positions Causal Tracing as a paired-intervention method to directly estimate indirect causal effects of individual hidden states.

## Knowledge Extraction Benchmarks

- Cloze-style factual extraction from LMs: Petroni et al. (2019, 2020), Jiang et al. (2020), Zhong et al. (2021), Roberts et al. (2020).
- ParaRel dataset (Elazar et al., 2021a) used as source material for COUNTERFACT construction.

## Knowledge Editing Methods

- MLP memory interpretation and neuron editing: Geva et al. (2021), Dai et al. (2022).
- Hypernetwork-based editors: KE (De Cao et al., 2021), MEND (Mitchell et al., 2021).

[p. 10] Claimed novelty: a single-layer closed-form rank-one intervention with strong specificity/generalization tradeoff behavior in autoregressive GPT models.
