# Conclusion [p. 10]

[p. 10] The paper concludes that:

- causal interventions reveal structured information flow during factual recall,
- middle-layer MLP computations at subject-token processing are central to factual associations,
- this understanding enables a simple model editor (ROME) with strong empirical behavior on rewriting tasks.

[p. 10] The authors emphasize single-fact locality as a demonstrated mechanism and point to subsequent work for scalable multi-fact editing.
