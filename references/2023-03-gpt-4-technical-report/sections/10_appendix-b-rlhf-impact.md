# Appendix B: Impact of RLHF on Capability [p. 28]

[p. 28] To test the impact of RLHF on the capability of the base model, the authors ran the multiple-choice question portions of the exam benchmark on the GPT-4 base model and the post-RLHF GPT-4 model. The results are shown in Table 8.

> "Averaged across all exams, the base model achieves a score of 73.7% while the RLHF model achieves a score of 74.0%, suggesting that post-training does not substantially alter base model capability." [p. 28]

For free-response questions, it is difficult to compare the base and RLHF models on an even footing, as the methodology for sampling free-response answers likely benefits from the model's ability to do instruction following. [p. 28]

## Table 8

**Table 8.** Comparison between GPT-4 base and GPT-4 post-RLHF on exam benchmarks. Averaged across all exams, the base model achieves an average score of 73.7% while the RLHF model achieves an average score of 74.0%, which suggests that post-training does not substantially alter base model capability.
