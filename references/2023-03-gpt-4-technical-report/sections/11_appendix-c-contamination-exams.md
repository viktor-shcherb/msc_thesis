# Appendix C: Contamination on Professional and Academic Exams [p. 28-30]

[p. 28-29] Cross-contamination between the evaluation dataset and the pre-training data is measured using substring match. Both evaluation and training data are processed by removing all spaces and symbols, keeping only characters (including numbers). For each evaluation example, three substrings of 50 characters are randomly selected (or the entire example if it is less than 50 characters). A match is identified if any of the three sampled evaluation substrings is a substring of the processed training example. This yields a list of contaminated examples. These are discarded and the scores rerun to get uncontaminated scores. [p. 29]

**Limitations of the filtering approach:** [p. 29]
- The substring match can result in false negatives (if there is a small difference between the evaluation and training data) as well as false positives.
- Only partial information from the evaluation examples is used, utilizing just the question, context, or equivalent data while ignoring answer, response, or equivalent data.
- In some cases, the multiple-choice options are also excluded. These exclusions may lead to an increase in false positives.

[p. 29] The RLHF post-training dataset is vastly smaller than the pretraining set and unlikely to have any particular question contaminated. However the authors did not check explicitly.

> "As can be seen in tables 9 and 10, contamination overall has very little effect on the reported results." [p. 29]

## Table 9

**Table 9.** Contamination data for Exams (Summary). For each of the exams tested, the fraction of questions which are contaminated (i.e. present in the training dataset) is shown. The final scores and corresponding percentile of human test takers for GPT-4 (with and without vision) on the full test are shown, and the extrapolated performance from only the uncontaminated subset of the questions on the test. For the AP exams, a range is reported because many students receive the same final score (e.g. on AP Art History, 14% of students receive a 5/5, so the percentile range for that score is 86%-100%). Note that some exams (e.g. codeforces, Unified Bar Exam) contain no images nor contamination, so the score is identical in all cases. Overall across most exams, both contamination and vision have relatively little effect. [p. 30]

## Table 10

**Table 10.** Contamination data for Exams (Details). Detailed contamination information on each of the exams tested, listed from most-to-least contaminated. Exams with both multiple choice questions (MCQ) and free-response questions (FRQ) are split into separate rows. For each set, the number of questions and fraction which are contaminated (appear in the training set) are listed. GPT-4's performance (as percentage of max score) is reported on the overall set, on the non-contaminated questions, and on only the contaminated set. The degradation (non-contaminated percent minus contaminated) is generally small and as often positive as negative, from which the authors conclude that contamination is not a substantive confounder on the overall results.
