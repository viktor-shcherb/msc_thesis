# Conclusion [p. 14]

[p. 14] GPT-4 is characterized as a large multimodal model with human-level performance on certain difficult professional and academic benchmarks. GPT-4 outperforms existing large language models on a collection of NLP tasks, and exceeds the vast majority of reported state-of-the-art systems (which often include task-specific fine-tuning). The authors find that improved capabilities, whilst usually measured in English, can be demonstrated in many different languages. Predictable scaling allowed accurate predictions on the loss and capabilities of GPT-4.

GPT-4 presents new risks due to increased capability, and the authors discuss some of the methods and results taken to understand and improve its safety and alignment. Though there remains much work to be done, GPT-4 is described as representing
