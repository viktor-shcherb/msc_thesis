# Scope and Limitations of this Technical Report [p. 2]

[p. 2] The report focuses on the capabilities, limitations, and safety properties of GPT-4. GPT-4 is described as:
- A Transformer-style model [39] pre-trained to predict the next token in a document
- Trained using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and data licensed from third-party providers
- Fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [40]

> "Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar." [p. 2]

The authors state commitment to independent auditing of their technologies and have shared initial steps and ideas in the system card accompanying the release. They plan to make further technical details available to additional third parties who can advise on weighing competitive and safety considerations against the scientific value of further transparency.
