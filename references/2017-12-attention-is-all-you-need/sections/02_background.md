# 2 Background [p. 2-3]

The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18], and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions: linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect counteracted with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. [p. 2]

Self-attention (sometimes called intra-attention) is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence. It has been used successfully in reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]. [p. 2]

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34]. [p. 2]

The authors claim the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, the authors describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention, and discuss its advantages over models such as [17], [18], and [9]. [p. 2]
