## 6.1 Large Language Models [p. 20]

[p. 20] The excitement of LLMs began with the introduction of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which was then applied to pretraining large-scale data by researchers such as Radford et al. (2018); Devlin et al. (2018); Liu et al. (2019). These efforts led to significant success in transfer learning, with model sizes growing from 100 million to over 10 billion parameters (Raffel et al., 2020; Shoeybi et al., 2019).

[p. 20] In 2020, the release of GPT-3, a massive language model that is 10 times larger than T5, demonstrated the incredible potential of few-shot and zero-shot learning through prompt engineering and in-context learning, and later chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022c). This success has led to a number of studies exploring the possibilities of further scaling these models (Scao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Du et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2022; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022). As a result, the community has come to view these large language models as essential foundations for downstream models (Bommasani et al., 2021).

[p. 20] The birth of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and the subsequent launch of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) marked two historic moments in the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrating that large language models (LLMs) can serve as effective AI assistants capable of communicating with humans. These events have sparked interests among researchers and developers in building language models that are aligned with human values and potentially even capable of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) (Anil et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2023a,b).

[p. 20] One notable development in this area is the emergence of open-source LLMs, specifically LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) and LLAMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), which have been recognized as the most powerful open-source language models ever created. This has led to a surge of activity in the open-source community (Wolf et al., 2019), with a series of large language models being developed collaboratively to build upon this progress (Mosaic ML, 2023; Almazrouei et al., 2023; ChatGLM2 Team, 2023; Yang et al., 2023; InternLM Team, 2023).

## 6.2 Alignment [p. 20–21]

[p. 20] The community was impressed by the surprising effectiveness of alignment on LLMs. Previously, LLMs without alignment often struggle with issues such as repetitive generation, hallucination, and deviation from human preferences. Since 2021, researchers have been diligently working on developing methods to enhance the performance of LLMs in downstream tasks (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2021; Longpre et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2022). Furthermore, researchers have been actively exploring ways to align LLMs with human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Askell et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022b,c). One major challenge in alignment research is the difficulty of collecting data. While OpenAI has utilized its platform to gather human prompts or instructions, it is not feasible for others to collect such data.

[p. 21] However, there has been some progress in this area, such as the self-instruct approach proposed in Wang et al. (2023c). This innovative work offers a potential solution to the data collection problem in alignment research. As a result, there has been a surge in open-source chat data, including Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), MOSS (Sun et al., 2023a), Dolly (Conover et al., 2023), Evol-Instruct (Xu et al., 2023b; Xu et al., 2023a,c; Chen et al., 2023c; Ding et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023; Yang, 2023). Similarly, there has been an increase in open-source chat models, such as Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), Guanaco (Dettmers et al., 2023), MOSS (Sun et al., 2023a), WizardLM (Xu et al., 2023b), and others (Xu et al., 2023c; Chen et al., 2023c; Ding et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b).

[p. 21] To train an effective chat model, available solutions are mostly based on SFT and RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022). While SFT is similar to pretraining, it focuses on instruction following using the aforementioned data. However, for many developers, the limited memory capacity is a major obstacle to further SFT. As a result, parameter-efficient tuning methods, such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and Q-LoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023), have gained popularity in the community. LoRA tunes only low-rank adapters, while Q-LoRA builds on LoRA and utilizes 4-bit quantized LLMs and paged attention (Dettmers et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Kwon et al., 2023). In terms of RLHF, recent methods such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017; Touvron et al., 2023b) have been adopted, but there are also alternative techniques aimed at addressing the complexity of optimization, such as RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023c), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), and PRO (Song et al., 2023). Despite the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of RLHF, more evidence is needed to understand how it enhances the intelligence of LLMs and what potential drawbacks it may have.

## 6.3 Tool Use and Agents [p. 21]

[p. 21] LLM's planning function allows for the invocation of tools, such as APIs or agent capabilities, through in-context learning, as demonstrated by Schick et al. (2023). Yao et al. (2022) introduced ReAct, a generation format that enables the model to generate thoughts on which tool to use, accept input from API observations, and generate a response. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, when prompted with few shots, have shown consistent and impressive performance. In addition to tool usage, LLMs can utilize external memory sources like knowledge bases (Hu et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023b) or search engines (Nakano et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b) to generate more accurate and informative answers. This has led to the popularity of frameworks like LangChain (LangChain, Inc., 2023). The research on LLMs for tool use has also sparked interest in building agents with LLM capabilities, such as agents that can call different AI models (Shen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a), embodied lifelong learning or multimodal agents (Wang et al., 2023a; Driess et al., 2023), and multiple agents interacting with each other and even building a micro-society (Chen et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023b; Xu et al., 2023d; Hong et al., 2023).

## 6.4 LLM for Coding [p. 21–22]

[p. 21–22] Previous research has demonstrated that LLMs possess remarkable capabilities in code understanding and generation, particularly those with massive numbers of parameters (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Moreover, several LLMs have been pre-trained, continued pre-trained, or fine-tuned on coding-related data, which has resulted in significantly improved performance compared to general-purpose LLMs. These models include Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022), SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023), Starcoder-Base (Li et al., 2023d), InCoder (Fried et al., 2022), CodeT5 (Wang et al., 2021), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), and CODE LLAMA (Roziere et al., 2023). In addition to these models, recent studies have focused on developing specialized alignment techniques for coding, such as Code Llama-Instruct (Roziere et al., 2023) and StarCoder (Li et al., 2023d). These models can assist developers in various code-related tasks, including code generation (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021), code completion (Zhang et al., 2023a), code translation (Szafraniec et al., 2023), bug fixing (Muennighoff et al., 2023), code refinement (Liu et al., 2023c), and code question answering (Liu & Wan, 2021). In a word, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the field of coding by providing developers with powerful tools for code comprehension, generation, and related tasks.

## 6.5 LLM for Mathematics [p. 22]

[p. 22] LLMs with a certain model scale have been found to possess the ability to perform mathematical reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b; Suzgun et al., 2022). In order to encourage LLMs to achieve better performance on math-related tasks, researchers have employed techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022c) and scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which have shown promising results. Additionally, self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) and least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022) have further improved the performance of these models on these tasks. However, prompt engineering is a time-consuming process that requires a lot of trial and error, and it is still difficult for LLMs to consistently perform well or achieve satisfactory results in solving mathematical problems. Moreover, simply scaling the data and model size is not an efficient way to improve a model's mathematical reasoning abilities.

[p. 22] Instead, pretraining on math-related corpora has been shown to consistently enhance these capabilities (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Taylor et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023). Additionally, fine-tuning on math-related instruction-following datasets (Si et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023a; Luo et al., 2023a; Yue et al., 2023; Chern et al., 2023a; Yu et al., 2023), has also been effective and more cost-effective than math-specific pretraining. Despite their limitations in terms of accuracy, LLMs still have significant potential to assist users with practical mathematical problems. There is ample scope for further development in this area.
