The Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test was first announced via an X thread on GPT-4-128K (November 8, 2023), followed by a second thread on Claude 2.1-200K (November 21, 2023). The methodology and code were released on GitHub. Despite being informal, NIAH became one of the most widely adopted long-context evaluation methods, cited as a standard benchmark in numerous peer-reviewed papers (RULER, BABILong, NoLiMa, LongBench v2, among others) and adopted in official model evaluation reports (e.g., Llama 3.1).
