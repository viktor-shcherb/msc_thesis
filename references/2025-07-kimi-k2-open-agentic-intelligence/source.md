Kimi K2 is a 1.04 trillion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 32 billion activated parameters, designed for agentic intelligence. The technical report describes the MuonClip optimizer for stable training, large-scale agentic data synthesis for tool use, and a general reinforcement learning framework combining verifiable rewards with self-critique rubric rewards. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models on agentic and coding benchmarks. Model weights are released under an open license.
