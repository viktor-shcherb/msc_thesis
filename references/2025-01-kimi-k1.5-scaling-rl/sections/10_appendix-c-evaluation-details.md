**AIME 2024** [p. 25]:
- Comprises the competition questions for the AIME in 2024 [p. 25]
- The AIME is a prestigious, invitation-only math contest for top high school students [p. 25]
- Assesses advanced math skills and requires solid foundation and high logical thinking [p. 25]

**MATH-500** (Lightman et al. 2023) [p. 25]:
- A comprehensive mathematics benchmark that contains 500 problems on various mathematics topics including algebra, calculus, probability, and more [p. 25]
