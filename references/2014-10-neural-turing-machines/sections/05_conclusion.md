# 5 Conclusion [p. 22]

[p. 22] The authors have introduced the Neural Turing Machine, a neural network architecture that takes inspiration from both models of biological working memory and the design of digital computers. Like conventional neural networks, the architecture is differentiable end-to-end and can be trained with gradient descent. The experiments demonstrate that it is capable of learning simple algorithms from example data and of using these algorithms to generalise well outside its training regime.
